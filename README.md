# dotfiles
This repository contains a set of dotfiles that I use for my personal environment. Dotfiles are files starting with `.` in a unix based file system. They are commonly used to control settings and applications in your shell.


## Dotfiles at GitHub

GitHub uses dotfiles to configure personal settings for Codespaces. Find out more [here.](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/customizing-your-codespace/personalizing-codespaces-for-your-account#dotfiles)
